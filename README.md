This project addresses failed transactions due to network coverage issues by enabling offline transactions through QR codes. Users can preload funds into a digital wallet, allowing transactions to be recorded even without an internet connection. Once the network is restored, the system syncs transactions to the server. Web3 integration ensures secure UPI payments, and all transactions are stored on a public blockchain for transparency and data integrity.

**Key Features:**

**Offline Transactions** – Enables payments without internet access using QR codes.

**Preloaded Wallet** – Users add funds online and transact offline.

**Sync Mechanism** – Transactions update automatically when connectivity is restored.

**Web3 Integration** – Ensures secure and decentralized transaction records.

**Blockchain Storage** – Provides transparency and prevents data tampering.
